[offer-food]
description = "You stumble around in the dark, reaching for a tin of cat food. You find one and pull it open, cutting yourself in the process. As you search for a bowl you hear a licking sound, surely cleaning up your blood drops, ever getting closer, ever getting closer. With great haste you prepare the food and place it on the floor. The licking turns to crunching, before fading away. Leaving you, alone in the house, in the dark."
